## Citing Us
Citing software is just as important as citing any other important sources in your research. If you're not sure whether or not to cite something, [Shouldacite](http://mr-c.github.io/shouldacite/index.html) can help you decide if you should (hint, the answer's probably yes!). If you use InterMine to do any of the following activities, please cite InterMine following our [citation guidelines](/about-intermine/#how-to-cite-us):

- Create your own instance of InterMine
- Use an InterMine to gather data for your research
- Used an InterMine API to create an interesting or exciting application or script

Also, don't forget to let us know about it! We love hearing from our community members, and we'd love to add your publication or citation to our list! You can also join our open [Zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2117194/intermine/items/) and add publications directly.
