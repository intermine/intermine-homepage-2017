InterMine has a large variety of repositories in a number of different languages. We have [a list of issues marked up with labels such as "Help Wanted", "Beginner", "Good first bug"](/contributing/tickets-to-try) that you can choose from, but you're welcome to offer help on any issue if you think you understand what's going on and what needs to be done.

### Picking up tasks
If you find an issue that interests you, here's what to do. Note that one of the key tasks is communication!

1. Read through the issue and **make sure you understand what to do**. If you need to clarify details, it's okay to ask in the issue.
2. Once you feel you're ready to work on the issue, **comment on the issue** to let us know you're working on it! This is important to ensure that no-one else picks up the ticket and works on it at the same time.
3. **Work on the issue** - make sure to conform to any guidelines there may be in the repo if relevant, e.g. write tests and make sure the pass in CI, comment and document your code, make sure the style formatting checks pass, etc. Ask for advice if needed.
4. When you think your work is ready - **make a pull request**! You're a star! ⭐️
5. We will **review your work**, checking for quality and correctness. It may take us a little while to review it, depending on what else is going on at the time. We may have feedback or changes required before we can merge your pull request.
6. Once it's merged - bask in glory. You've just committed code to an open source project!

- Be nice. Unpleasant behaviour in our community will not be tolerated. InterMine has a [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) that all contributors are expected to follow.

- If an individual repository has contributing guidelines or style guidelines, they override any advice given on this page.
