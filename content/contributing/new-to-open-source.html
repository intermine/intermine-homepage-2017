<div class="im-post-intro">
    Perhaps you’ve never made a pull request before, or you’ve used git a little but never
    collaboratively? Have
    a look
    through the open source guide to submitting contributions to give you a good idea of how things
    work.

    Some of our issues are marked first-timers-only - these are issues that may be relatively
    straightforward,
    where we’ll
    happily walk you through steps you’re unsure about. (psst, you can also search GitHub for all issues
    marked
    with this
    label, not just InterMine).
