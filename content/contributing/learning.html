    Welcome! We're excited to have you join the community. InterMine integrates biological data, but you don't have to
    be a biologist to contribute to InterMine. Some of our entry-level issues only require knowledge of the relevant
    programming language, but others may require more in-depth understanding.

        If you’d like to learn a bit more about InterMine, we have a nice 5 minute video for you to sum things up.
        If you prefer textual learning resources, you could look at the <a class="im-link" href="/im-docs">InterMine
            documentation</a> for a technical overview of
        InterMine’s server, the <a class="im-link" href="/intermine-user-docs/">user documentation</a> a for a
        biologist/bioinformatician oriented overview, or you could hop
        straight into our <a class="im-link" href="/training-portal/python-tutorial">Python tutorial</a> to learn
        more about querying our data model.

        You can also take a look at the <a class="im-link" href="/developers">Developers</a> section of this site.
