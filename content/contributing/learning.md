Welcome! We're excited to have you join the community. InterMine integrates biological data, but you don't have to be a biologist to contribute to InterMine. Some of our entry-level issues only require knowledge of the relevant programming language, but others may require more in-depth understanding.

If you'd like to learn a bit more about InterMine, we have a nice 5 minute video for you to sum things up:

If you prefer textual learning resources, you could look at the [InterMine documentation](/im-docs/) for a technical overview of InterMine's server, the [user documentation](/intermine-user-docs/) for a biologist/bioinformatician oriented overview, or you could hop straight into our [Python tutorials](/training-portal/python-tutorial/) to learn more about querying our data model.

You can also take a look at the [Developers](/developers) section of this site.
