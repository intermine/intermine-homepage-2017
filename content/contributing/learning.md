Welcome! We're excited to have you join the community. InterMine integrates biological data, but you don't have to be a biologist to contribute to InterMine. Some of our entry-level issues only require knowledge of the relevant programming language, but others may require more in-depth understanding.

If you'd like to learn a bit more about InterMine, we have a nice 5 minute video for you to sum things up:

If you prefer textual learning resources, you could look at the [InterMine documentation](https://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a technical overview of InterMine's server, the [FlyMine tutorials](https://flymine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/DocumentationOverview.html) for a biologist/bioinformatician oriented overview, or you could hop straight into our [Python tutorials](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/intermine/intermine-ws-python-docs/master) to learn more about querying our data model.

You can also take a look at the [Developers](/developers) section of this site.
