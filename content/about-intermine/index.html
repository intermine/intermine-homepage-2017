<p class="im-post-intro">
    InterMine is an open source data warehouse system for the integration and analysis of complex biological data,
    developed by the Micklem Lab at the University of Cambridge. InterMine has been used for developing data warehousing
    solutions for a number of projects, including for storage and analysis of modENCODE data, and as a data mining
    platform for a number of major model organism databases as part of the InterMOD project.

    InterMine has been principally funded by the Wellcome Trust [067205], [082598], [090297], [099133], [208381] with
    additional funding from the BBSRC [BB/L027151/1], [BB/P024335/1], Innovate UK [KTP011266] as well as support from
