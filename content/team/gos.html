InterMine is part of the Micklem Lab, led by Gos Micklem. Gos is also director
of the {{<external-link href="http://www.ccbi.cam.ac.uk/" title="Cambridge Computational Biology Institute">}}. Gos
can often be found writing grants and winning
{{<external-link href="https://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/" title="Department of Genetics">}}
awards for enthusiastic lecturing. (He says that this was probably a statistical anomaly).
