<p>InterMine was formed in 2002 at the University of Cambridge, originally as a Drosophila-dedicated resource, before expanding to become organism-agnostic, enabling a large range of organisations around the world to create their own InterMines. The InterMine team is part of <a href="http://www.micklemlab.org/">Micklem lab</a>, headed by Gos Micklem.</p>

<h3>Meet the team</h3>
InterMine's core team members are all based in Cambridge and are generally available during <a href="https://time.is/Cambridge">UK daytime hours</a>.
