  If you’re an organisation that runs an InterMine, there’s a good chance you have (or wish to have!) a community around
  you that may need engagement, training, support, and encouragement to join in. We run quarterly
  {{<external-link href="https://github.com/intermine/outreach/issues/" title="Community Outreach Calls">}}, where we
  talk about different ways to run a successful, happy community.

  The call info ({{<external-link href="https://github.com/intermine/outreach/issues/15" title="2019">}},
    {{<external-link href="https://github.com/intermine/outreach/issues/9" title="2018">}}) is always posted on GitHub
    so others can comment openly and add suggestions.

      Frequently Asked Questions
    </h2>

    <h3 class="im-post-section-h3">
      What topics does the outreach call cover?
    </h3>
    <div class="im-post-section-para">
      We try to cover any and all topics related to working with your community - whether this might be bringing in
      new
      contributors, preprints and open science, training your community members, addressing diversity and
      inclusivity,
      managing social media streams, interesting upcoming events, etc. We generally have 1-2 guest speakers per
      call.

    <h3 class="im-post-section-h3">
      What sort of audience attends this call?
    </h3>
    <div class="im-post-section-para">
      Our call audience is generally between 10 and 30 people, a mixture of InterMine users, curators, students,
      invited
      speakers, developers, and sometimes also attendees from outside the InterMine community who are interested in
      the call
      topics. We avoid any overly techie themes in these calls, as backgrounds vary.
