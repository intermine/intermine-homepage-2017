  InterMine developer calls are held roughly once a month, on the first tuesday of the month, generally at 17:00 UK time
  (with occasional time shifts around daylight savings clock changes). These calls are generally techie-oriented and
  consist of topics such as:

  <ul class="im-post-ul">
    <li>
      Upcoming technical updates to InterMine.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discussions regarding the InterMine data model.
    </li>
    <li>
      General updates, e.g. upcoming training events, Google Summer of Code, conferences.
    </li>
  </ul>

  The call is open to anyone, but developers and InterMine admins are especially encouraged to attend. Calls are shown
  on
  the {{<external-link href="https://intermineorg.wordpress.com/events/" title="InterMine Calendar">}}, and agendas with
  joining instructions are sent to
  the {{<external-link href="https://lists.intermine.org/mailman/listinfo/dev" title="developer mailing list">}} before
