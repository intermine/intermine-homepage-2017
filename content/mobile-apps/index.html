  InterMine's mobile apps allow you to carry the power of multiple InterMines in your pocket.
  They include a cross-InterMine search tool, as well as alowing you to browse lists,
  templates, and to create a selection of "favourites" - perhaps a set of publications to
  review or a collection of interesting genes.
